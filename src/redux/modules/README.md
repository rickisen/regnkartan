# Redux pattern

This folder and its subfolders' structure are implemented in a "ducks"
compatible way. Which is a neat way of structuring redux modules.

Ducks helps with maintaining a structure that makes it's quick and easy to add
and modify reducers and redux logic without having to modify any unrelated
code. Some of the larger ducks have been broken up into multiple files but they
should still follow the important parts of the ducks-pattern.
